=== STARTING ADVANCED COLLISION TESTS ===

--- SCENARIO 1: Multicast Clash (P0 vs P1 targeting P2 & P3) ---
[95] DRIVING Port 0 -> Target 1100 (Data=a0)
[95] DRIVING Port 1 -> Target 1100 (Data=b0)
   [RECV] @145 Port 2 Output: a0
   [RECV] @145 Port 3 Output: a0
   [RECV] @155 Port 2 Output: b0
   [RECV] @155 Port 3 Output: b0
   [CHECK] Ports 2 & 3 should receive A0 then B0 (or vice versa).

--- SCENARIO 2: Broadcast (P2) vs Unicast (P3 -> P0) ---
[305] DRIVING Port 2 -> Target 1111 (Data=ff)
[305] DRIVING Port 3 -> Target 0001 (Data=33)
   [RECV] @355 Port 0 Output: ff
   [RECV] @355 Port 1 Output: ff
   [RECV] @355 Port 2 Output: ff
   [RECV] @355 Port 3 Output: ff
   [RECV] @365 Port 0 Output: 33
   [CHECK] IF P3 wins P0 first: P0 sees 33, then FF. Others see FF later.
   [CHECK] IF P2 wins P0 first: P0 sees FF, then 33. Others see FF immediately.

--- SCENARIO 3: Three-way Multicast Chain Reaction ---
[565] DRIVING Port 1 -> Target 1100 (Data=dd)
[565] DRIVING Port 3 -> Target 1111 (Data=ee)
[585] DRIVING Port 0 -> Target 0101 (Data=cc)
   [CHECK] Verify all packets arrived eventually without dropping.
